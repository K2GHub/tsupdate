+ Make sure that DEBUG = False in settings.py

+ Make sure to update ALLOWED_HOSTS in settings.py

+ Check if INTERNAL_IPS should be changed as well

+ Access and refresh lifetimes in SIMPLE_JWT should probably be discussed

+ The email SMTP definetly should be changed
    - code with mosh has an example (in deployement module) of a cheap one we could users

+ CHANNEL_LAYERS in settings.py also need to be checked if it should changed
    - we might need to change the redis config hosts but probably not an issue for not
    because we should only do that if we want to run the redis server on a different platform

+ Pipfile has all the dependencies we need in the direct environment, but 
there are some packages that we might still need to install on the global
computer environment to run certain things
    - Redis for example. We might need to run brew install redis or using docker

+ When you run "daphne -p 8001 thought_sync.asgi:application", is it working?
    - if it's working, what is the root of the websocket url?

+ maybe change BASE_DIR / "db.sqlite3", to os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "db.sqlite3"),
